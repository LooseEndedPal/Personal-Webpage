      <h2>Computer Programmer and Analysis Student</h2>
      <p>
        Hi my name is Ethan. As a computer Programmer I'm drive to learn anything about programming and love putting long amounts into coding 
        itself. The most frustrating part about coding is solving the problems we as programmers face, which is why to me it's always
        so satifying to me when a problem is solved or when I finally understand something new. No matter where I am in my coding journey
        I hope to continue solving problems and learning new things in coding.
